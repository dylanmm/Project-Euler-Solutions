# Project Euler Solutions

This is a collection of my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems-- coded exclusively in C. Each problem folder contains the C code in `solution.c` and any notes about the problem in the folder's `README.md`.

This repository is the product of my personal resolution to work more in C. I strive to answer each Euler problem with the most efficient solution, however, I am still learning and welcome all edits and feedback!
